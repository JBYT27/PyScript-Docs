# The Unofficial and Official PyScript Docs
##### Coded and created by @JBYT27

## About
Most of the information will be located on the website, so you can read there. However, for the original language link, it's [here](https://github.com/JBYT27/PyScript-Compiler).

## Code
This is the docs, so I won't talk about too much about the code, but all I'm gonna say is that this was made with [react.js](https://reactjs.org).

## Contributing
To contribute, you can leave PR's, but if you don't have [github](http://github.com/), you can either **ping** me in [replit](https://replit.com/). However, if I need *severe* needs of help, I might invited you to either the repo or the repl. 

## Suggestions
I might add a suggestions tab to the website. But in the meantime, if you could ping me in github, leave issues, or ping me in replit, that would most likely reach out to me the best. Thanks!

## Conclusion
This is both an official and unofficial language, not much to say to that, but just stating a fact ;)
